Full Stack React and Spring Boot Application

Full Stack Application with Spring, Spring Boot, React, and Spring Security

This repository contains a full stack application built with Spring, Spring Boot, React, and Spring Security. The application is a Todo list app that allows users to create, read, update, and delete todos.

Technologies Used :

Spring: A Java-based framework for building enterprise-level applications
Spring Boot: A framework for building stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications
React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
Spring Security: A framework for securing Spring-based applications


To get started with the application, follow the steps below:

Setting Todo REST API Project for React Full Stack Application:
Create a new Spring Boot project and configure it to include the necessary dependencies for building a REST API. This includes the Spring Web, Spring Data REST, and Hibernate Validator modules.

Calling Spring Boot Hello World REST API from React Hello World Component:
Create a new React application and add a Hello World component that makes a request to the Spring Boot Hello World REST API.

Enabling CORS Requests for Spring Boot REST API:
Configure the Spring Boot application to allow Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) requests from the React application.

Invoking Spring Boot Hello World Bean and Path Param REST API from React:
Create a new React component that invokes the Spring Boot Hello World Bean and Path Param REST API.

Refactoring Spring Boot REST API Invocation Code to New Module:
Refactor the Spring Boot REST API invocation code to a new module to keep the codebase organized and maintainable.

Following Axios Best Practices in Spring Boot REST API:
Follow best practices when using Axios in the Spring Boot REST API, such as using interceptors for error handling and request/response transformations.

Creating Retrieve Todos Spring Boot REST API Get Method:
Create a new REST API endpoint in the Spring Boot application that retrieves a list of todos.

Displaying Todos from Spring Boot REST API in React App:
Display the todos retrieved from the Spring Boot REST API in the React application.

Creating Retrieve Todo and Delete Todo Spring Boot REST API Methods:
Create new REST API endpoints in the Spring Boot application that retrieve a single todo and delete a todo.

Adding Delete Feature to React Frontend:
Add a delete feature to the React frontend that allows users to delete todos.

Setting Username into React Auth Context:
Set the username into the React Auth Context to keep track of the currently authenticated user.

Creating Todo React Component to display Todo Page:
Create a new Todo React Component that displays the Todo page and handles user interactions.

Adding Formik and Moment Libraries to Display Todo React Component:
Add Formik and Moment libraries to the Todo React Component to handle form validation and date formatting.

Adding Validation to Todo React Component using Formik:
Add validation to the Todo React Component using Formik to ensure that user input is valid.

Adding Update Todo and Create Todo REST API to Spring Boot Backend API
